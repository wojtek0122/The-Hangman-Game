# The-Hangman-Game
Motorola Academy Task

My beginning with programming was about 8 years ago, when find out first "mmorpg game engine" written in Visual Basic. Start was very hard, without any tutorials or courses about programming. I tried modifie code and looking what happens in game. After few years i written my own game in Visual Basic. Next was C++ and SFML where I writed games for hobby - 2 izometric games. Unfortunatelly when I was went to work my hobby was close zero, because do not have enought time. Now i come back to progrtamming and learn again.
